                Why should you adopt an animal?
                Along time ago animals lived in
                forests and nature but when people started
                Taming them they became pets. Imagine that you
                are hungry or you don’t have a house to be in of
                course you will be sad...
                don’t forget that animals feel too
                As you want a safe home to be in animals
                want too,so when you want to adopt an animal to
                feed it and to help a sick animal it will be a big
                Step in humanity Another thing, today psychologists Say
                that if you have an animal in your house this Will
                change your mood positively specially when you are sad
                and have problems it’s like slime But in another way, you
                might be shy to share your problems with your friends
                but I don’t think you will be shy with sharing
                them with your new best friend your animal that
                you’re getting it from Anibook.
