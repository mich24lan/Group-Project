            Why should you adopt an animal?
            Along time ago animals lived in forests and nature but when people started Taming them they became pets.
            Imagine that you are hungry or you don’t have a house to be in of course you will be sad...don’t forget that animals feel too
            As you want a safe home to be in animals want too,so when you want to adopt an animal to feed it and to help a sick animal it will be a big Step in humanity
            Another thing, today psychologists Say that if you have an animal in your house this Will change your mood positively specially when you are sad and have problems it’s like slime But in another way, you might be shy to share your problems with your friends but I don’t think you will be shy with sharing them with your new best friend your animal that you’re getting it from anibook
